Send us an email File a bug on GitHub Reach out on the Discord Safety # Always use caution when working with electricity. While Micronova does not use mains power directly and operates on relatively low voltages ( -12V to 20V DC ), there is always risk. Never add or remove downstream devices or modify power connections while the system is powered on. Make sure to use an appropriate AC to DC power supply and to stay within the specified power limits . Use high-quality cables and appropriately sized wires when making connections. Micronova includes some protection features: It can withstand at least 30V of reverse polarity on the power inputs It has transient voltage suppression on the power inputs It has a polyfuse to limit current during a short circuit fault It has independent over-current, short circuit, and over-temperature protection on each of the downstream power rails These protection features do not avert all risks involved with operating a power supply. Micronova can still experience dangerous faults from unexpected events. Improper usage significantly increases the possibility of electric shock and fire. Always use caution . Powering Micronova # Micronova requires a 15 to 20V DC power supply that can provide at least 1A . Micronova has multiple, interconnected power input connections. It can be powered using one of the two DC barrel jacks or one of the two screw terminal blocks on the upper side of the board. Warning Never connect more than one upstream power supply at a time to Micronova. The multiple DC jacks and screw terminals for daisy chaining multiple Micronova units to a single upstream supply. Only one upstream power supply should be connected. Connecting multiple upstream power supplies can result in irreversible damage, electric shock, and fire. In most cases, you'll want to use one of the DC barrel jacks. Both Micronova and the optional front entry panel have DC barrel jacks, and either of the two jacks will work. They accept plugs that have a 2.1mm inner diameter and a 5.5mm outer diameter. The plug should be center positive . These AC to DC power supplies are recommended if you're planning to use the DC barrel jacks: Mean Well GST60A15-P1J which provides 15V @ 4A (60W) , enough to power about four Micronovas. Mean Well GST40A15-P1J which provides 15V @ 2.6A (40W) , enough to power two or three Micronovas. Mean Well GST25A15-P1J which provides 15V @ 1.6A (25W) , enough to power one Micronova. All of these power supplies are rated for international use and require a separate IEC C13 cord to connect to your wall outlet. These cords are incredibly common and often used with computers, monitors, and professional audio and video equipment and should be readily available from local retailers. If you need help finding a power supply or want to double check compatibility before purchasing, please reach out to us . In some advanced or unusual racks, you may want to power Micronova through its screw terminals. This might be the case if you're using a large DC power supply such as Mean Well's RS series . Ensure that the power supply's voltage output is between 15V and 20V . You can use either of the two screw terminal blocks on the upper side of the board- just not the one labeled switch . Connect the power supply to Micronova using appropriately sized hook up wire ( 20 or 22 AWG stranded is recommended). Connecting modules # Connect your modules to Micronova using either 16-to-10 pin IDC cables or 16-to-16 pin IDC cables. Be careful to note the polarity of the cable and the connectors on your modules. Polarity indication on modules varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but most note the side that the red stripe ( -12V ) should be on. Micronova uses keyed headers so it shouldn't be normally possible to connect power cables backwards on that end. If you'd like to power more than two modules, you can use a Busboard or a flying bus cable . Power limits # Micronova has limits on how much power it can provide to downstream modules: +12V rail: 1A -12V rail: 300mA +5V rail: 500mA When connecting multiple modules make sure that the overall current draw does not exceed these limits. Check with each module's manual or manufacturer to determine the current required. Modulargrid is also a valueable resource for estimating your system's power requirements. If your set up requires more power than a single Micronova can provide, you can daisy chain multiple units. Warning Overloading Micronova can cause irreversible damage to Micronova and connected modules. While Micronova has over-current protection on each rail, the voltage drop-out that occurs when this protection is activated can still cause damage in rare cases. There are a few ways you can check to make sure that you're within Micronova's limits. The first, and easiest, is to check the four LEDs on the board. They should all be illuminated and three of them should be roughly the same brightness, with the one near the 5V label being slightly dimmer. Any LEDs that are not illuminated or are very faint indicate an issue with your setup. The photo below shows a correctly functioning unit. The second way is to check the temperature of Micronova's DC-DC converters. These are the three black boxes on the lower-left of the board. You can use a touchless thermometer, thermal camera, or touch the top of them with your finger. It is normal for them to be slightly warm but excessive heat means that Micronova is overloaded. Busboard # Micronova's two power outputs can be expanded using the optional busboard . You'll need to connect Micronova to the busboard using the included 16 pin IDC cable. When connecting multiple modules, make sure to stay within Micronova's power limits . If you need more power than one Micronova can provide, you can daisy chain two or more units. Daisy chaining # You can power multiple Micronova units from a single DC power supply. If the Micronova units are in separate cases, you can connect them together using a DC jumper cable : If you have more than one unit within a single case, you can connect them together using the screw terminal blocks: You can use any combination of the DC jacks and screw terminals to daisy chain as long as there is only one power supply . Make sure your power supply can provide enough power to satisfy the current demand of the Micronova units. A good rule of thumb is that you need 1A to 2A for each Micronova. Power switch # In some cases you may want to add a power switch to Micronova, such as cases where it's hard to unplug or reach the power supply. There are a few options. First, if you're using the front entry kit there's a power switch on there, so you're all set! Second, you can use an in-line DC power switch . This is connected between your AC to DC power supply and Micronova's DC barrel jack. This is useful for small cases where it's easy to reach the power cable and helps reduce wear on the power cable since you don't have to constantly plug and unplug it. Lastly, you can wire a switch to Micronova's switch screw terminal block. This is useful in cases where the power cable is not easily accessible or you're powering Micronova through a large DC power supply. We recommend a switch like the E-Switch EG5448-ND . If you get an illuminated switch, make sure the LED can handle 15-20V . You'll need to wire each terminal of the switch to the terminal block as shown: You'll also need to sever the copper trace beneath the switch terminal block. The trace is shown in red. Use a sharp utility knife or razor blade and carefully cut along the dot lines. There is extra empty space around the trace to make it easier to cut without damaging anything. If you change your mind later and no longer need the switch, you can either place a jumper wire between the two terminals on the terminal block or solder the two pads next to the severed trace together. Output terminals # In addition to the two Eurorack 16-pin power headers, Micronova can provide downstream power through the two screw terminals located on the lower side of the board. Always be aware of Micronova's power limits when connecting downstream devices. Front entry kit # If you prefer connecting your case's power supply through the front, the optional front entry kit provides a 4 HP panel with two DC barrel jacks and an illuminated power switch. This is only available as a kit, please refer to the build guide for instructions on how to assemble and connect the front entry kit. Dimensions # If you'd like to physically mount your Micronova in your case, the following dimensions may be useful. You can download the SVG and you can also refer to the KiCAD files for the board's hardware design . Open source hardware & software # Micronova is completely open source and hacking is encouraged. The hardware designs are available under the permissive CERN-OHL-P v2 and is designed using KiCAD which is free and open-source. You can open the hardware files using KiCAD or you can check out a PDF of the schematic .

We hope you have a great time putting your Micronova together and a wonderful time using it. Please read all instructions thoroughly before starting. If you have questions or run into trouble please reach out to us on discord or drop us an email . Some soldering experience is helpful but not required. If it's your first time soldering we recommend reading through Adafruit's guide to excellent soldering . This is a beginner level kit. Some soldering experience is helpful but not required, though we recommend practicing on another project first. We also have some slightly easier kits available, such as our Helium kit . Even if you've got some experience, we recommend taking a look at Adafruit's guide to excellent soldering . This build takes around one hour to complete. Tools required Kit contents Screw terminals IDC headers DC barrel jacks DC-DC converters Busboard Front entry kit All done Tools required # Before you begin, make sure that you've got: Safety glasses. Yes, really . A pair like these are fine. Proper ventilation, like this small filtered fan . A temperature-controlled soldering iron, like this Hakko or the Pinecil . It is very important to use a temperature-controlled iron, since unregulated irons can easily get hot enough to damage components. You should set your iron temperature based on your solder manufacturer's recommendations. Solder. We recommend Adafruit's SAC305 solder or Kester 275 K100LD . A small flat head screwdriver, like [this one][small screwdriver]. Flux We suggest using solder with \"no clean\" flux. If you use a different kind of flux, be sure to carefully clean the flux residue off based on the guidelines provided by the manufacturer of your solder. Take special care with the LEDs and potentiometers, as they can be damaged by water and flux cleaners. Kit contents # Your kit should contain the following items. If any are missing please email us at support@winterbloom.com . Mainboard 12V DC-DC converters 5V DC-DC converter 16 pin IDC headers DC barrel jacks Screw terminal blocks (1) Mainboard (2) DC barrel jacks (5) 2-pin screw terminal blocks (2) 16 pin shielded IDC headers (2) 12V DC-DC converters (1) 5V DC-DC converter Screw terminals # The first step is placing and soldering the five 2-pin screw terminal blocks. It's easiest to solder one terminal block at a time. Place a terminal block on the front side of the board, taking care to place it so that the terminal openings face outward and match up with the triangles on the board. Hold the terminal block in place and flip the board over. It's okay if the terminal block isn't completely flush against the board, as long as the legs are through the holes. Solder one leg of the terminal block to hold it in place. Lift the board and use your iron to reflow the solder and push the terminal block flush against the board. Wait a few seconds for the joint to solidify before releasing the board. With the terminal block now flush against the board, solder the second leg into place. Repeat this process for the four remaining terminal blocks, taking care to align the terminal openings. IDC headers # Your next task is placing and soldering the two 16 pin shielded IDC headers. Place both of them on the front side of the board, being careful to align the notch in the header's shield with the drawing on the board. The board is designed to hold on to these headers tightly, so you might have to give a little pressure to push them all the way in. Once you have both placed, flip the board over and solder just one pin on each header to tack it in place. Double check that both headers are completely flush against the board, if they aren't, you can fix them using the same technique you used with the screw terminals. Once you've checked the placement, solder all 16 pins on both headers. You should be able to do them both at the same time, but if you're having trouble feel free to do them one at a time like you did with the terminal blocks. DC barrel jacks # Next up is placing and soldering the two DC barrel jacks. Similar to the terminal blocks, it's easiest to place these one at a time. Place one on the front side. Then carefully flip the board over and solder just one leg to hold the barrel jack in place. Just as you did with the terminal blocks, lift the board and use your iron to reflow the solder and push the barrel jack flush against the board. Wait a few seconds for the joint to solidify before releasing the board. With the barrel jack flush and held in place, solder the remaining two legs. Finally, repeat this process for the second barrel jack. DC-DC converters # The last step is to solder the three DC-DC converters. There are two 12V converters and one 5V converter. You'll need to identify them before placing them since they must be placed correctly for Micronova to work. The single 5V converter is slightly smaller and has VX7805-500 marked on it. The two 12V converters are slightly larger and has K7812M-1000R3 marked on it. Start by placing the 5V converter on the front side of the board. It goes in the spot labeled 5V on the lower left. Make sure the converter is oriented correctly so that it fits nicely within the white rectangle on the board. Carefully flip the board over and solder one leg to hold the converter in place. Using the same technique as the DC barrel jacks and terminal blocks, reflow the solder and push the DC-DC converter flush against the board. Once the DC-DC converter is flush, solder the remaining legs. Repeat for the two 12V converters. They go into spots adjacent to the 5V converter marked 12V . Again, make sure that they are oriented to match up with the corresponding white rectangle on the board. You're all done! If you have a busboard kit or a front entry kit, continue reading. If not, hop down to the end for some useful links. Busboard # The busboard kit adds six additional power headers to your Micronova. Your busboard kit should contain the following items. If any are missing please email us at support@winterbloom.com . (1) Busboard PCB (7) 2x8 pin shielded IDC headers (1) 16 pin to 16 pin IDC cable (not pictured) Assembling the busboard kit is fairly straightforward. Start by placing all seven IDC headers on the front side of the board, making sure to align the notch in the header's shield with the drawing on the board. The board is designed to hold on to these headers tightly, so you might have to give a little pressure to push them all the way in. Flip the board over and solder one pin on each header to tack them into place. Make sure that the headers are all flush against the board and adjust if needed by re-heating the solder joints. Once you're sure they're all flush, solder them all in to place. That's it! \ud83d\ude42 Front entry kit # The front entry kit lets you power your Micronova via a 4hp panel in your rack. Your front entry kit should contain the following items. If any are missing please email us at support@winterbloom.com . (1) Front entry panel (2) Panel mount DC barrel jacks, including washers and nuts (1) Rocker switch (2) M3x6 mounting screws (not pictured) You will need hook up wire to assemble this module. We recommend 20 or 22 AWG stranded wire in red and black. The first step is to prepare four 13cm (5\") lengths of wire- two red, and two black. Strip the sleeve 1cm on both ends. You also need two lengths of wire that will connect from the front panel to the Micronova board inside your case. Make sure you have enough length to reach and strip the sleeve 1cm on both ends. Mount the switch in the panel, making sure that the - is facing upwards. The panel's switch cutout has a very tight fit, so you may have to compress the plastic springs on the switch to get it to snap into place. Mount the two DC barrel jacks to the panel, placing the washer and nut onto the jack from the front side of the panel. Wire the jacks and switch together as shown below, being care to wire the the correct leads on the barrel jacks. With everything wired up, give it a quick test by plugging in a power cable and making sure that the switch illuminates when switched on. If it does not illuminate or if it stays illuminated even when off, double-check your wiring before continuing. If everything checks out, mount the panel in your rack. Run the power wires to your Micronova and use the screw terminals to connect them. All done # Congratulations! You've finished your very own Micronova!

Take special care with the LEDs and potentiometers, as they can be damaged by water and flux cleaners.","title":"Tools required"},{"location":"build/#kit-contents","text":"Your kit should contain the following items.

It's easiest to solder one terminal block at a time. Place a terminal block on the front side of the board, taking care to place it so that the terminal openings face outward and match up with the triangles on the board. Hold the terminal block in place and flip the board over. It's okay if the terminal block isn't completely flush against the board, as long as the legs are through the holes. Solder one leg of the terminal block to hold it in place. Lift the board and use your iron to reflow the solder and push the terminal block flush against the board. Wait a few seconds for the joint to solidify before releasing the board. With the terminal block now flush against the board, solder the second leg into place. Repeat this process for the four remaining terminal blocks, taking care to align the terminal openings.","title":"Screw terminals"},{"location":"build/#idc-headers","text":"Your next task is placing and soldering the two 16 pin shielded IDC headers. Place both of them on the front side of the board, being careful to align the notch in the header's shield with the drawing on the board. The board is designed to hold on to these headers tightly, so you might have to give a little pressure to push them all the way in. Once you have both placed, flip the board over and solder just one pin on each header to tack it in place. Double check that both headers are completely flush against the board, if they aren't, you can fix them using the same technique you used with the screw terminals. Once you've checked the placement, solder all 16 pins on both headers. You should be able to do them both at the same time, but if you're having trouble feel free to do them one at a time like you did with the terminal blocks.","title":"IDC headers"},{"location":"build/#dc-barrel-jacks","text":"Next up is placing and soldering the two DC barrel jacks. Similar to the terminal blocks, it's easiest to place these one at a time. Place one on the front side. Then carefully flip the board over and solder just one leg to hold the barrel jack in place. Just as you did with the terminal blocks, lift the board and use your iron to reflow the solder and push the barrel jack flush against the board. Wait a few seconds for the joint to solidify before releasing the board. With the barrel jack flush and held in place, solder the remaining two legs. Finally, repeat this process for the second barrel jack.","title":"DC barrel jacks"},{"location":"build/#dc-dc-converters","text":"The last step is to solder the three DC-DC converters. There are two 12V converters and one 5V converter. You'll need to identify them before placing them since they must be placed correctly for Micronova to work. The single 5V converter is slightly smaller and has VX7805-500 marked on it. The two 12V converters are slightly larger and has K7812M-1000R3 marked on it. Start by placing the 5V converter on the front side of the board. It goes in the spot labeled 5V on the lower left. Make sure the converter is oriented correctly so that it fits nicely within the white rectangle on the board. Carefully flip the board over and solder one leg to hold the converter in place. Using the same technique as the DC barrel jacks and terminal blocks, reflow the solder and push the DC-DC converter flush against the board. Once the DC-DC converter is flush, solder the remaining legs. Repeat for the two 12V converters. They go into spots adjacent to the 5V converter marked 12V . Again, make sure that they are oriented to match up with the corresponding white rectangle on the board. You're all done! If you have a busboard kit or a front entry kit, continue reading. If not, hop down to the end for some useful links.","title":"DC-DC converters"},{"location":"build/#busboard","text":"The busboard kit adds six additional power headers to your Micronova. Your busboard kit should contain the following items. If any are missing please email us at support@winterbloom.com . (1) Busboard PCB (7) 2x8 pin shielded IDC headers (1) 16 pin to 16 pin IDC cable (not pictured) Assembling the busboard kit is fairly straightforward. Start by placing all seven IDC headers on the front side of the board, making sure to align the notch in the header's shield with the drawing on the board. The board is designed to hold on to these headers tightly, so you might have to give a little pressure to push them all the way in. Flip the board over and solder one pin on each header to tack them into place. Make sure that the headers are all flush against the board and adjust if needed by re-heating the solder joints. Once you're sure they're all flush, solder them all in to place. That's it! \ud83d\ude42","title":"Busboard"},{"location":"build/#front-entry-kit","text":"The front entry kit lets you power your Micronova via a 4hp panel in your rack. Your front entry kit should contain the following items. If any are missing please email us at support@winterbloom.com . (1) Front entry panel (2) Panel mount DC barrel jacks, including washers and nuts (1) Rocker switch (2) M3x6 mounting screws (not pictured) You will need hook up wire to assemble this module. We recommend 20 or 22 AWG stranded wire in red and black. The first step is to prepare four 13cm (5\") lengths of wire- two red, and two black. Strip the sleeve 1cm on both ends. You also need two lengths of wire that will connect from the front panel to the Micronova board inside your case. Make sure you have enough length to reach and strip the sleeve 1cm on both ends. Mount the switch in the panel, making sure that the - is facing upwards. The panel's switch cutout has a very tight fit, so you may have to compress the plastic springs on the switch to get it to snap into place. Mount the two DC barrel jacks to the panel, placing the washer and nut onto the jack from the front side of the panel. Wire the jacks and switch together as shown below, being care to wire the the correct leads on the barrel jacks. With everything wired up, give it a quick test by plugging in a power cable and making sure that the switch illuminates when switched on. If it does not illuminate or if it stays illuminated even when off, double-check your wiring before continuing. If everything checks out, mount the panel in your rack. Run the power wires to your Micronova and use the screw terminals to connect them.","title":"Front entry kit"},{"location":"build/#all-done","text":"Congratulations!
